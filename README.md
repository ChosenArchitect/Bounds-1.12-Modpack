Bounds is a 1.12 Vanilla+ Hardcore Modpack. This pack is centered around progressing through Better With Mods. You start off in a world with nothing and are faced with tough mobs and world generation that forces you to explore and find new structures. You will need to work for the tools that you would normally take for granted. If you can survive you will prosper and have the world at your fingertips.

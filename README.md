Bounds is a 1.12.2 Vanilla+ Hardcore Modpack. This pack is centered around the progressing through Better With Mods. You start off in a world with nothing and are faced with tougher than normal mobs and world generation that forces you to explore and find new structures. You will need to work for the tools that you would normally take for granted because basic tools will not mine the deeper layers of the earth. If you can survive you will prosper and have the world at your fingertips.

You'll start your first world with nothing. No map or location information.  As you progress, you will be able to craft the items necessary to find out where you are and mark important locations. Your goal is to make it through each day with the intent to better your weapons, tools, armor and living conditions as you progress!

This pack has been tested and is fully compatible with multiplayer.

### Note:
This pack will continue to add content after its initial release. I plan on adding more to the end-game, and bug fixes along the way. I will do my best to make sure no update will corrupt worlds and the new updates will work as intended.

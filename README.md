# Bounds 1.12 Modpack

Bounds is a 1.12 Vanilla+ Hardcore Modpack. This pack is centered around progression through Better With Mods. You start off in a world with nothing and are faced with tough mobs and world generation that forces you to upgrade your tools and armor. Each time you craft a tool you will receive a ranking that will either give you an advantage or disadvantage much like in Terraria. If you can survive you will prosper and have the world at your fingertips.

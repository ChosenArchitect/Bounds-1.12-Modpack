    Bounds is a 1.12.2 Vanilla+ Hardcore Modpack. This pack is centered around the progressing through Better With Mods. You start off in a world with nothing and are faced with tougher than normal mobs and world generation that pushes you to explore and find new structures to loot. You will need to work for the tools that you would normally take for granted because basic tools will not mine the deeper layers of the earth. If you can survive you will prosper and have the world at your fingertips.


This pack has been tested and is fully compatible with multiplayer.

 

Note: For those on weaker or older computer disable Blur and Better Foliage

### Note:
This pack will continue to add content after its initial release. I plan on adding more to the end-game, and bug fixes along the way. I will do my best to make sure no update will corrupt worlds and the new updates will work as intended.
